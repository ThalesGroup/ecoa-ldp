# ECOA LDP: Lightweight Development Platform for the ECOA standard

[ECOA] (European Component Oriented Architecture) is an open specification of a software framework 
for component-based avionics mission system software.

ECOA allows to develop _real-time_, _embeddable_ software, in the form of simple, independent and testable _components_.

The Lightweight Development Platform is a simple ECOA platform, implementing the ECOA standard, version [AS7].
It allows anyone to develop, test and run, ECOA components.
It is also a great tool to learn and evaluate ECOA on a ordinary Linux computer or Virtual Machine.

The Lightweight Development Platform is developed by [Thales] Defence Mission Systems.
