# Contributing to the ECOA LDP

**Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to the ECOA LDP!**

This document explains how we (Thales, the copyright holder) intend to develop the ECOA LDP with the community.

There are several ways in which you can contribute, beyond writing code. The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how you can get involved.

## Ways to contribute

Please note that the ECOA LDP is still in its early versions, and at this stage we (Thales) intend to keep a strong leadership and control
on its evolutions.

### **Did you find a bug?**

* Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/thalesgroup/ecoa_ldp/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/thalesgroup/ecoa_ldp/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **full set of input models sample** or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.  Simplify your models around the issue to better isolate the problem.

### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability or functionality of the LDP will generally not be accepted.

### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Make sure your change is consistent with the ECOA standard. Discuss it at ECOA standard level first.

* If it is, please open an issue on GitHub **before** going into detailed implementation proposals. 
Pull requests that have not been discussed at the specification/design stage will generally not be accepted.

* Do not feel bad if a pull request is rejected, or heavily modified. 
The LDP shares a lot of common code with internal Thales products, so a constraints exist that you may not be aware of.

* Do not feel bad if getting feedback on an issue or pull request takes some time. 
The LDP is made available for free, and manpower available in Thales
to work on it may vary greatly.

* By definition, the LDP is _lightweight_ and is **not** intended to be a full, industrial-grade ECOA execution platform. 
Therefore, many topics, especially dealing with performance, security, safety, are considered irrelevant.
We will generally reject changes dealing with these topics. 

### **Do you have an idea or suggestion?**

We're also interested in your feedback for the future of the ECOA LDP. You can submit an idea or a suggestion through the issue tracker. To make this process more effective, we're asking that these include more information to help define them more clearly.

## Discussion Etiquette

In order to keep the conversation clear and transparent, please limit discussion to English and keep things on topic with the issue. Be considerate to others and try to be courteous and professional at all times.

## Thank You

Your contributions to open source, large or small, make great projects like this possible. Thank you for taking the time to contribute.
